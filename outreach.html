      <div class="project-text2">
      Besides astronomy research, I have gained experience in <strong> <span class="highlight-bluedark"> teaching and science communication. </span> </strong> I have worked as a teaching and grading assistant for several courses at my university. Two of these courses <strong> <span class="highlight-bluedark"> — Data Analysis and Astronomy Laboratory — </span> </strong> allowed me to refine my programming skills in Python and to work with software such as <strong> <span class="highlight-bluedark"> SExtractor </span> </strong> and <strong> <span class="highlight-bluedark"> TOPCAT </span> </strong>, as students engaged directly with images, large databases, and statistics applied to astronomy in cloud-based environments.<br><br>
      I have also organized workshops and help sessions for students in my faculty, focusing on programming tools such as Python and LaTeX.<br><br>
      Additionally, I participated as an assistant at the university’s observatory in <strong> <span class="highlight-bluedark"> Santa Martina </span> </strong>, where I gained experience in communicating science in an accessible way to students from non-scientific backgrounds, as well as developing skills in outreach and public speaking.<br><br>

      </div>
      I also enjoy taking part in activities that support new students and help them feel welcome in the astronomy community. For that reason, I joined the <strong> <span class="highlight-bluedark"> Tutores Pares </span> </strong> program organized by the Faculty of Physics. This experience helped me strengthen my social and communication skills, as the program focuses on guiding first-year students in their transition to university life.<br><br>

      Beyond my formal roles, I actively participate in various outreach activities in my free time :) These include school talks, children’s workshops, livestream panel discussions, and public events organized by my university’s astronomy institute — such as the Solar Telescope activity, where I participated as a guide.<br><br>
